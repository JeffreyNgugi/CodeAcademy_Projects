# Twitch Part 2: Visualize Data with Matplotlib

https://www.codecademy.com/courses/dspath-twitch/articles/twitch-project

[Twitch.tv](www.twitch.tv) is the world’s leading video platform and community for gamers, with 15+ million unique daily visitors. Using data to understand its users and products is one of the chief responsibilities of the [Twitch Science Team](https://science.twitch.tv/).

Welcome to Part 2 of the Twitch Project. In this part of the project, you will be taking your findings from the SQL queries and visualize them using Python and Matplotlib, in the forms of:

- [x] [`Bar Graph: Featured Games`](Bar Graph: Featured Games)  
- [x] [`Pie Chart: Stream Viewers’ Locations`](Pie Chart: Stream Viewers’ Locations) 
- [x] [`Line Graph: Time Series Analysis`](Line Graph: Time Series Analysis) 


Thank you for CodeAcademy and Twitch for this partnership:
