# Twitch Part 2: Visualize Data with Matplotlib

[Twitch.tv](www.twitch.tv) is the world’s leading video platform and community for gamers, with 15+ million unique daily visitors. Using data to understand its users and products is one of the chief responsibilities of the [Twitch Science Team](https://science.twitch.tv/).

Welcome to Part 2 of the Twitch Project. In this part of the project, you will be taking your findings from the SQL queries and visualize them using Python and Matplotlib, in the forms of:

- [x] [`Bar Graph: Featured Games`](Bar Graph: Featured Games)  
- [x] [`Pie Chart: Stream Viewers’ Locations`](Pie Chart: Stream Viewers’ Locations) 
- [x] [`Line Graph: Time Series Analysis`](Line Graph: Time Series Analysis) 

The SQL queries were converted to csv files named; LOL_viewers, popular_games and viewers_time. To find out more of how they were created [Click here](https://github.com/JeffreyNgugi/CodeAcademy_Projects/tree/master/SQL/Twitch%20Project)
