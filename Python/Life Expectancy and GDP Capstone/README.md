# Capstone Project: Life Expectancy and GDP Data

For this project, you will act as a data researcher for the World Health Organization. You will be helping them analyze data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

During this project, you will analyze, prepare, and plot data, and seek to answer questions in a meaningful way.

After you perform analysis, you’ll be creating a blog post to share your findings on their website.


## TASK 1: ANALYZING DATA

You will be completing this project on your own computer, similar to the other off-platform projects that we’ve done throughout the intensive.

Welcome to Part 2 of the Twitch Project. In this part of the project, you will be taking your findings from the SQL queries and visualize them using Python and Matplotlib, in the forms of:

- Download the [Life Expectancy and GDP project](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/programs/dataviz-python/unit-6/Life+Expectancy+and+GDP+Capstone.zip)  
- Double-click on it to “unzip” the folder. It should contain several items:
    - all_data.csv
    - life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb

## TASK 2: EXPORT DATA VISUALIZATIONS

In the file life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb, there are instructions for the different visualizations needed in the stock profile. Read and complete each instruction so that you can export your files as a visualization.
