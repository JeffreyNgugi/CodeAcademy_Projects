# Codecademy + Twitch


[Twitch.tv](www.twitch.tv) is the world’s leading video platform and community for gamers, with 15+ million unique daily visitors. Using data to understand its users and products is one of the chief responsibilities of the [Twitch Science Team](https://science.twitch.tv/).

In this project, you will be working with two training tables that contain Twitch users’ stream (video) viewing data and chat room usage data on January 1st, 2015. The Twitch Science Team provided this practice dataset. You can download the .csv files (800,000 rows) from [Github](https://github.com/sonnynomnom/Codecademy-Learn-SQL-from-Scratch/tree/master/Twitch).

- [x] [`stream.csv`](stream.csv)
